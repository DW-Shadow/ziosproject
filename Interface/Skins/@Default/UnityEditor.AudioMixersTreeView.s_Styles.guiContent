tooltip = All mixers in the project are shown here. By default a mixer outputs to the AudioListener but mixers can also route their output to other mixers. Each mixer shows where it outputs (in parenthesis). To reroute a mixer simply drag the mixer upon another mixer and select a group from the popup.
